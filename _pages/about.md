I am Xian Zhang, a Ph.D. student in Health Services Research & Policy in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Rochester Medical Center.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Corporate Finance from the Shanghai University of International Business and Economics in 2017, and my Master’s degree in Economics from Duke University in 2019.

From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a consultant on Universal Health Coverage at the World Bank Group under the supervision of Economist Sven Neelsen. I then served as a Research Fellow at the Global Health Research Center of Duke Kunshan University (2021–2024), supervised by Prof. Lijing L. Yan. Most recently, I was a Research Fellow supported by the PKU Young Scholar Fellowship in Global Health and Development (2024–2025).
